# WebMCP (Web Model Context Protocol)
# Google Web MCP related information
There are two ways to make your website WebMCP enabled.
## 1 - Declarative API
A web developer can add metatags like "toolname" and "tooldescription" to existing HTML Forms.

## 2 - Imperative API
Software programmer can use JavaScript to implement registerTool() method. For example a software developer may implement JS functions like searchProducts(query, filters) or orderPrints(copies, page_size) with full parameter schemas and natural language descriptions.

### Supported Web Browsers (As of Late February 2026)
* Google Chrome _(experimental)_
* Microsoft Edge _(coming soon)_
* Mozilla FireFox _(not yet planned)_

### Note:
This is not a headless browsing standard. It requires approvals from web user before proceeding. Remember its WebMCP where web user is watching the activities being performed agentic ai and not A2A (Agent to Agent) Protocol in which processing can be done behind the scence. Also Anthropic's MCP operates as a back-end protocol connecting AI platforms to service providers through hosted servers, WebMCP operates entirely client-side (using Tags/JavaScript or Web Scraping) within the browser. An analogy can be given as WebMCP aims to become the USB-C of AI agent interactions with the web.
